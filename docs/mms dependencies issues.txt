Upgrade Lucene to the 3.6 (see also Hibernate Search 4.2).

depends
 MODE-1763 Upgrade to Infinispan 5.2.1.Final
 
ModeShape 3.1.3.Final still depends on Infinispan 5.1.2.Final and Hibernate Search 4.1.1.Final

Hibernate Search 4.1.1.Final cannot use Lucene 3.6+ because:
  RuntimeException: java.lang.VerifyError: class org.hibernate.search.reader.impl.CacheableMultiReader overrides final method incRef.()V
  (method incRef in MultiReader class of Lucene is final in 3.6+ and overridable in Lucene 3.5.0)
  
Elasticsearch 0.5.3+ depends on Lucene 3.6.2


Need to either:
a) force using Lucene 3.5 if possible
b) upgrade Modeshape to latest snapshot release


A) might work - missing some specific dependencies - nope still missing new class in 3.6.0 ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.lucene.analysis.ga.IrishAnalyzer

Trying B) 3.2-SNAPSHOT from local build
